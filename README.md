# MACC-Benchmark

MACC-Benchmark is a benchmarking tool designed to evaluate memory access performance across various programming languages. The benchmark executes a series of standardized memory access actions: sequentially write, random read, random write, sequentially read.

### Memory Access Actions

Every benchmark executes exactly the same memory access actions: 
- **Sequential Write**: Write 2^30 pseudo-random bytes sequentially. 
- **Random Read**: Read 1 byte at a pseudo-random position, repeated 2^30 times.
- **Random Write**: Write a pseudo-random byte to a pseudo-random position, repeated 2^30 times.
- **Sequential Read**: Read 2^30 bytes sequentially.

### Notes
1. Each test is performed 5-10 times. Results table shows the average value in milliseconds.
2. Results table was automitically generated using [TestResultsComposer.java](https://github.com/pavel-chumakou/MACC-Benchmark/blob/main/results/TestResultsComposer.java) tool:
```bash
java ./results/TestResultsComposer.java ./results/win11_amd_8840hs/
```
3. [C2](https://github.com/c2lang/c2compiler) language has C backend. It means that results for C and C2 should be mostly the same.
4. Surprisingly standard Java byte[] array outperforms Java Unsafe/Memory API for sequential memory ac—Åess (random access is also good).
5. [B language](https://github.com/tsoding/b) is not fully implemented yet, I added it mostly just for fun. However, B has some potential in low-level programming.
   
### ToDo
1. Add C#, Rust, Ada, Go, Odin, Zig, Hare, Jai, Python, Nim, Pascal
2. Re-test it on Linux platform (currently I have only my work Win11 laptop with non-disableable antivirus, not good for performance testing)
3. Repeat the tests for smaller memory buffers (2^24 - 2^29). It will be intersting to investigate relative changes in performance with variable memory buffer and fixed CPU cache/ memory bandwidth. Most likely C or Rust implementations will be enough for such benchmarks.
