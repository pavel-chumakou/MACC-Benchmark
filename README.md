# MACC-Benchmark

Memory access benchmarking tool designed to evaluate memory access performance across various programming languages. The benchmark executes a series of standardized memory access actions: sequentially write, random read, random write, sequentially read.

### Memory Access Actions

Every test run executes exactly the same memory access actions: 
- **Sequential Write**: Write 2^30 pseudo-random bytes sequentially. 
- **Random Read**: Read 1 byte at a pseudo-random position, repeated 2^30 times.
- **Random Write**: Write a pseudo-random byte to a pseudo-random position, repeated 2^30 times.
- **Sequential Read**: Read 2^30 bytes sequentially.
